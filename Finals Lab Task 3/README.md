* product_name: String (VARCHAR) with a maximum length of 100, cannot be null.
* price: Decimal

## STEP 2: Add a CHECK constraint to ensure that the price of the product must be > 0.

## STEP 3: Insert the products that will not violate the check constraint into the products table:

* Product 1: "Laptop", 999.99
* Product 2: "Headphones", -49.99
* Product 3: "Smartphone", 599.99
* Product 4: "Tablet", 299.99
* Product 5: "Monitor", -149.99
* Product 6: "Keyboard", 19.99
* Product 7: "Mouse", 14.99
* Product 8: "Desk Lamp", 24.99
* Product 9: "External Hard Drive", -79.99
* Product 10: "Speakers", 9.99
