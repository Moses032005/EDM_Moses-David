## About Me ##
Hi everyone! My name is Moses David, and I'm a first-year BSIS (Bachelor of Science in Information Systems) student. I've always been interested by technology, and I'm excited to get started into the world of systems, programming, and innovation. Beyond the screen and code, there's another passion that keeps me inspired which is music.
